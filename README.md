# Weeks Until
Simple website that tells you how many weeks until a future date

This is my first app that came directly from my head to reality without a specific tutorial.

**For future**
* Add weeks and days until.
* Clean up CSS and make it reactive.
* Work properly with timezones?
* Replace placeholder text for date input.
